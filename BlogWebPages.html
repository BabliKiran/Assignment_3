        <p>Welcome to my simple blog!</p>
        <p><b>Here you'll find information about web development and web design.</b><br/><u>Web Development:</u> Building and maintaining websites, applications, and online platforms using programming languages, frameworks, and databases to create a functional product.<br/><br/><u>Web Design:</u> Creating the visual and interactive aspects of a website, application, or online platform, focusing on user experience, user interface, and visual design to make it look and feel great.</p>
        <p>Web development and web design are two different things that work together to create a website. Web development is like building the website, making sure it works properly and has all the features it needs. It's like building a house, where you need to make sure the foundation is strong, the walls are sturdy, and the roof doesn't leak. Web design, on the other hand, is like decorating the house, making it look nice and pretty, and arranging the furniture in a way that makes sense. It's about creating a website that looks good, is easy to use, and provides a good experience for the people visiting it.</p>
